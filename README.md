CS 4310 Project 2 - Virtual addresses, disk scheduling, logical block numbers

## Task 1
Simply compile and run Main.java. The program will prompt for page size (in KB) and the virtual address.

## Task 2
Compile and run Main.java. The program will prompt for an input file (if blank, it will create 1000 random requests). The program will ask for the previous and current cylinder. Then, it will schedule all requests based on the FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN algorithms, and give statistics for each one.

## Task 3
Simply compile and run Main.java. The program will prompt for logical block number, number of cylinders, number of tracks, and number of sectors. It will then output the block number in `<Cylinder, Track, Sector>` format.
